  <div class = "section1">
    <h9>Natural selection</h9>
    <p>Individuals with favourable phenotypes suited for their environment are likely to survive to reproduce.</p>
  </div>

  <div class = "section2">
    <h9>Genetic drift</h9>
    <p>Genetic drift is the change in allele frequencies in populations due to chance events.</p>
    <p>there are two types of genetic drift:</p>
    <p>Bottleneck effect - When a significant drop in population occurs due to environmental events/human activity. </p>
    <p>Founder effect - when a small number of individuals from a larger population,establish a new one.</p>
                   <p> this population would be reproductively isolated from the original population.</p>
  </div>



  <div class = "glossary">
    <h8>Definitions</h8>
    <p>Species: A group of individuals that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring.</p>
    <p>Speciation: The formation of different species from a common ancestor/ancestral species.</p>
    <p>Gene Flow: movement of alleles between populations/gene pools .</p>
    <p>selection pressures: Factors that affect fitness/reproductive success.</p>
    <p>Mutations: Random,permanent changes in the DNA base sequence.</p>
    <p>Genetic Drift: random,permanent change in the DNA base sequence</p>
    <p>Migration: When individuals move from one poulation to another.</p>
