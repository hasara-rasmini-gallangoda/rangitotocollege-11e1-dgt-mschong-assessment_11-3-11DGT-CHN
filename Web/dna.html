   <h9>Structure of DNA</h9>

   <p>DNA is a double stranded molecule twisted into a double helix.</p>
   <p>It is made up of repeating sub units called nucleotides.</p>
   <p>Each nucleotide is made up of a phosphate sugar (deoxyribose),and a base joined together.</p>
   <p>There are 4 bases that are paired together by complementary base pairing:</p>
   <p>Adenine(A) - Thymine(T)</p>
   <p>Cytosine(C) - Guanine(G)</p>

   <div class = "section2">
    <h9>Homologous chromosomes</h9>

    <p>Individuals inherit two copies of each chromosome - one from each parent.</p>
    <p> therefore every individual carries two copies of the same gene.However,they may carry different alleles. </p>
    <p>sister chromatids are duplicated chromosomes that are connected to one another at their centromere.</p>
    <p> They have the same alleles as they are copies of one another. </p>

    <br>

    <h9>How is the genetic code read?</h9>
    <p>The genetic code is read 3 bases at a time on the DNA base sequence,known as a triplet</p>
    <p>Each tiplet codes for one amino acid.</p>
    <p>The order of the amino acid sequence determines the final protein made</p>
    <p>Each amino acid is connected to another by peptide bonds,to form a polypetide chain.</p>
   </div>

   
  

   <div class ="section3">
    <h9>Mutations</h9>

    <p>A mutation is a random,permanent,change in the DNA base sequence.</p>
    <p>They are the only source of new alleles(and therefore genetic variation) in a species.</p>
    <br>
    <p>point mutations are mutations that only affect a single/few bases</p>
    <p>there are four types of point mutations: </p>

        <h10 class = "title">Substitution</h10>

      <div class="box"> 
        <h10 class = "title">Insertion</h10>

      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h10 class="title">Deletion</h10>

    <h8>Definitions</h8>
    <p>DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid - A molecule that carries genetic information.</p>
    <p>Chromosomes: thread-like structures that contain long lengths of dna.</p>
    <p>Gene: A section of DNA that codes for a particular trait/characteristic.</p>
    <p>Allele: Alternate forms of a gene.</p>
    <p>Mutations: Random,permanent changes in the DNA base sequence.</p>
    <p>Homologous Chromosomes: pairs of chromosomes that are the same length,and carry the same genes at the same location (loci) as each other. </p>
